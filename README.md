### üéØ Demo & Testing

A comprehensive demo environment showcases all healing capabilities:

## Prerequisites

- **Go toolchain**: Required for generating Kubernetes CRDs and running the demo.
  - Install with Homebrew (macOS):  
    ```sh
    brew install go
    ```
  - Or follow instructions for your OS: https://golang.org/doc/install

> If Go is not installed, the setup will fail to generate required files.  
> You can verify Go is installed by running: `go version`

```bash
# Start the demo
cd demo
./setup.sh

# Watch healing in action
./monitor.sh

# Quick status check
./quick-demo.sh
```

The demo includes:
- **Crashloop healing**: Automatically fixes crashing pods
- **Memory leak mitigation**: Restarts pods with high memory usage
- **Service degradation handling**: Scales up based on error rates
- **AI-driven analysis**: Intelligent recommendations (optional)

## üìã Key Features

### 1. **Policy-Based Healing**
Define what to monitor and how to respond:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeskippy.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealingPolicy
metadata:
  name: memory-leak-healing
spec:
  selector:
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
  triggers:
  - name: high-memory
    type: metric
    metricTrigger:
      query: "memory_usage_percent"
      threshold: 85
      operator: ">"
  actions:
  - name: restart-pod
    type: restart
    priority: 10
```

### 2. **Multiple Trigger Types**
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, custom Prometheus queries
- **Events**: Kubernetes events (warnings, errors)
- **Conditions**: Pod/node conditions
- **AI-based**: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection

### 3. **Safe Remediation Actions**
- **Restart**: Rolling restart with configurable strategy
- **Scale**: Horizontal scaling up/down
- **Patch**: Apply configuration changes
- **Delete**: Remove and recreate resources

### 4. **AI-Powered Intelligence** (Optional)
- Local inference using Ollama (privacy-focused)
- Cloud inference using OpenAI API
- Root cause analysis and recommendations
- Learning from historical patterns

### 5. **Enterprise-Ready**
- Rate limiting prevents action storms
- Cooldown periods prevent flapping
- Audit trail for compliance
- Metrics for monitoring effectiveness

```

#### **Natural Language Policy Evolution**
```yaml
# Future: Define policies in plain English
policy: |
  "When any database pod uses more than 80% CPU for over 5 minutes, 
   scale it up by 1 replica, but never exceed 10 replicas, 
   and if that doesn't help within 10 minutes, restart the pod.
   
   If it's during business hours and revenue impact > $1000/hour,
   immediately escalate to the SRE team while attempting automated healing.
   
   Learn from similar incidents and adjust thresholds based on seasonal patterns."
```

### üåü **The Ultimate Vision: Infrastructure with Consciousness**

Imagine infrastructure that:
- **Thinks**: Uses advanced AI to understand complex system relationships
- **Learns**: Continuously improves from every interaction and outcome  
- **Feels**: Senses user frustration and business pain, not just technical metrics
- **Adapts**: Evolves healing strategies like a living organism
- **Communicates**: Explains its decisions in natural language
- **Collaborates**: Works with humans as a true partner, not just a tool
- **Dreams**: Simulates future scenarios during idle time to prepare for unknowns
- **Empathizes**: Understands the human cost of downtime and optimizes for happiness

This represents a paradigm shift from "Infrastructure as Code" to **"Infrastructure as Consciousness"** - autonomous systems that genuinely care about the applications and users they serve.
