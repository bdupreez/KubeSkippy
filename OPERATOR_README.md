# KubeSkippy Operator Implementation

## Overview

The core operator for KubeSkippy has been implemented with a focus on high-quality, testable code following Kubernetes operator best practices.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Project Structure**: Proper Go module setup with organized package structure
- **CRD Definitions**: HealingPolicy and HealingAction custom resources
- **Core Types & Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces for extensibility
- **Controllers**: Reconciliation logic for both HealingPolicy and HealingAction
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for core components
- **Main Entry Point**: Operator manager setup with proper configuration

### ðŸš§ Pending Implementation
- **Metrics Collector**: Integration with Prometheus and metrics-server
- **Safety Controller**: Validation rules and rate limiting
- **AI Analyzer**: Integration with Ollama for intelligent analysis
- **Remediation Engine**: Action executors for different healing types

## Running the Operator

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Kubernetes cluster (or Kind/Minikube)
- kubectl configured

### Build and Run Locally

```bash
# Install CRDs
kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/

# Run the operator locally
make run

# Or build and run the binary
make build
./bin/manager --metrics-bind-address=:8080 --health-probe-bind-address=:8081
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/controller -v
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **HealingPolicy Controller**
   - Watches HealingPolicy resources
   - Evaluates triggers based on metrics
   - Creates HealingAction resources when conditions are met
   - Supports different modes: monitor, dryrun, automatic, manual

2. **HealingAction Controller**
   - Watches HealingAction resources
   - Manages action lifecycle (Pending â†’ Approved â†’ InProgress â†’ Succeeded/Failed)
   - Handles approval workflow
   - Supports retry with exponential backoff

3. **Interfaces**
   - `MetricsCollector`: Abstracts metric collection
   - `SafetyController`: Validates actions and enforces safety rules
   - `RemediationEngine`: Executes healing actions
   - `AIAnalyzer`: Interfaces with AI for recommendations

### Safety Features

- Protected resources and namespaces
- Rate limiting for actions
- Approval workflows for risky operations
- Circuit breaker pattern for failure handling
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Example Usage

### Create a HealingPolicy

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeskippy.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealingPolicy
metadata:
  name: pod-restart-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  mode: automatic
  selector:
    namespaces: ["default"]
    resources:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: myapp
  triggers:
  - name: high-restarts
    type: metric
    metricTrigger:
      query: 'rate(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[5m]) > 0.1'
      threshold: 0.1
      operator: ">"
  actions:
  - name: restart-pod
    type: restart
    restartAction:
      strategy: rolling
      maxConcurrent: 1
```

## Development

### Adding New Action Types

1. Define the action in `api/v1alpha1/healingpolicy_types.go`
2. Implement the `ActionExecutor` interface
3. Register the executor in the remediation engine
4. Add tests for the new action type

### Extending Safety Rules

1. Add new validation logic to the `SafetyController` interface
2. Implement the validation in the safety controller
3. Update the HealingAction controller to use new validations
4. Add comprehensive tests

## Next Steps

To complete the operator implementation:

1. Implement the `MetricsCollector` with Prometheus integration
2. Implement the `SafetyController` with configurable rules
3. Create action executors for restart, scale, patch operations
4. Add AI integration for intelligent recommendations
5. Implement comprehensive e2e tests
6. Add observability with metrics and structured logging
